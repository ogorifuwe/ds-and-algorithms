Magic Index: A magic index in an array A[0...n-1] is defined to be an
index such that A[i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers,
write a method to find a magic index, if one exist, in array A.

What if the values are not distinct?

Hints:

    Start with a brute force algorithm

    Your brute force algorithm probably ran in O(N) time. If you're
    trying to beat that runtime, what do you think you will get to?
    What sorts of algorithms have that runtime?

    Can you solve the problem in O(log N)?

    Binary search has a runtime of O(long N). Can you apply a form
    of binary search to the problem?
