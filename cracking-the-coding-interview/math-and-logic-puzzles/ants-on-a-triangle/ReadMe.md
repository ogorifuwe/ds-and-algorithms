Ants on a Triangle: There are three ants on different vertices of a triangle.
What is the probability of collision (between any two or all three of them) if
they start walking on the sides of the triangle? Assume that each ant randomly
picks a direction, with either direction being equally likely to be chosen, and
that they walk at the same speed.
Similarly, find the possibility of collision with n ants on an n-vertex polygon.

Hints:

    *   In what cases do they collide?

    *   The only way they won't collide is if all three are walking in the
        same direction. What's the probability of all three walking clockwise?

    *   You can think about this either as the 
        probability(3 ants walking clockwise)
        + probability(3 ants walking counter-clockwise). Or, you can think
        about it as: The first ant picks a direction. What's the probability
        of the other ants picking the same direction?
