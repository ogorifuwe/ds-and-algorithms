Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unli-
mited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with
exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such
that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

Hints:

    *   Play around with the jugs of water, pouring water back and forth.
        and see if you can measure anything other than  3 quarts.
        That's a start

    *   If you fill the 5-quart jug and then use it to fill the 3-quart
        jug, you'll have two qaurts left in the 5-quart jug. You can
        either keep those two quarts where they are, or you can dump the
        content of the smaller jug and pour the two quarts in there

    *   Once you've developed a way to solve this problem, think about it
        more broadly. If you are given a jug of size X and another jug of
        size Y, can you always use it to measure Z?
