Blue-Eyed Island: A bunch of people are living on an island, when
a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must
leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a fight out
at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye
color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to
tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have
blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does.
How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

Hints:

    *   This is a logic problem, not a clever word problem.
        Use logic/math/algorithm to solve it.

    *   Suppose there were exactly one blue-eyed person. What
        would that person see? When would they leave?

    *   Now suppose there were two blue-eyed people. What would
        they see? What would they know? When would they leave?
        Remember your answer from the prior hint. Assume they
        know the answer to the earlier hint.

    *   Build up from this. What if there were three blue-eyed
        people? What if there were four blue-eyed people?
