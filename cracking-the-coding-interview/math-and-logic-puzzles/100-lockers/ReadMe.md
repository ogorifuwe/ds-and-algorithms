100 Lockers: There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by
opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then,
on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is
open or opens it if it is closed). This process continues for 100
passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker.
After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker
#100, how many lockers are open?

Hints:

    *   Given a specific door x, on which rounds will it be toggled
        (open or closed)?

    *   In which cases would a door be left open at the end of the process?

    *   Note: If an integer x is divisible by a, and b = x / a, then x is
        also divisible by b. Does this mean that all numbers have an even
        number of factors?

    *   The number 3 has an even number of factors (1 and 3). The number
        12 has an even number of factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). What numbers
        do not? What does this tell you about the doors?
