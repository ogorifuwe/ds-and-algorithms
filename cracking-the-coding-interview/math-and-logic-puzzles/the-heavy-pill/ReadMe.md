The Heavy Pill: You have 20 bottles of pills, 19 bottles have 1.0 gram
pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides
an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle?
You can only use the scale once.

    Hints:

    *   You can only use the scale once. This means that all, of the
        bottles must be used. They also must be handled in different ways
        or else you couldn't distinguish between them.

    *   What happens if you put one pill from each bottle on the scale?
        What if you put two pills from each bottle on the scale?

    *   Imagine there were just three bottles and one had heavier pills.
        Suppose you put different numbers of pills from each bottle on
        the scale (for example, bottle 1 has 5 pills, bottle 2 has 2
        pills, and bottle 3 has 9 pills). What would the scale show?

    *   You should be able to have an equation that tells you the heavy
        bottle based on the weight.
