The Egg Drop Problem: There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops
from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any
floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while mini-
mizing the number of drops for the worst case.

Hints:

    *   This is really an algorithm problem, and you shoukd approach it
        as such. Come up with a brute force, compute the worst-case
        number of drops, then try to optimize that.

    *   As a first approach, you might try something like binary search.
        Drop it from the 50th floor, then the 75th, the 88th, and so on.
        The problem is that if the first egg breaks at the 50th floor,
        then you'll need to start dropping the second egg starting from
        the ist floor and going up. This could take, at worst, 50 drops
        (the 50th floor drop, the ist floor drop, the 2nd floor drop, and
        up through the 49th floor drop). Can you beat this?

    *   It's actually better for the first drop to be a bit lower.
        For example, you could drop at the 10th floor, then the 20th
        floor, then the 30th floor, and so on. The worst case here will
        be 19 drops (10, 20, ..., 100, 91, 92, ..., 99). Can you beat
        that? Try not randomly guessing at different solutions. Rather,
        think deeper. How is the worst case defined? How does the number
        of drops of each egg factor into that?

    *   If we drop Egg 1 at fixed intervals (e.g., every 10 floors),
        then the worst case is the worst case for Egg 1 + the worst case
        for Egg 2. The problem with our earlier solutions is that as Egg
        1 does more work, Egg 2 doesn't do any less work. Ideally, we'd
        like to balance this a bit. As Egg 1 does more work (has survived
        more drops), Egg 2 should have less work to do. What might this
        mean?

    *   Try dropping Egg 1 at bigger intervals at the beginning and then
        at smaller and smaller intervals. The idea is to keep the sum of
        Egg 1 and Egg 2's drops as constant as possible. For each addi-
        tional drop that Egg 1 takes, Egg 2 takes one fewer drop. What
        is the right interval?

    *   Let X be the first drop of Egg 1. This means that Egg 2 would do
        X - 1 drops if Egg 1 broke. We want to try to keep the sum of Egg
        1 and Egg 2's drops as constant as possible. If Egg 1 breaks on
        the second drop, then we want Egg 2 to do X - 2 drops. If Egg 1
        breaks on the third drop, then we want Egg 2 to do X - 3 drops.
        This keeps sum of Egg 1 and Egg 2 fairly constant. What is X?

    *   I got 14 drops in the worst case. What did you get?
