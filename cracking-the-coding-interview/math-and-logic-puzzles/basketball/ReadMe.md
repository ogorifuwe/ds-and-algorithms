Basketball: You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you
can play one of two games.
Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop
Game 2: You get three shots and you have to make two of the three
        shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which
values of p should you pick one game or the other?

Hints:
    
    *   Calculate the probability of winning the first game and
        winning the second game, then compare them.

    *   To calculate the probability of winning the second game,
        start with calculating the probability of making the first
        hoop, the second hoop and not the third hoop.

    *   The probability of making two out of three shots is
        probability(make shot 1, miss shot 2, make shot 3) +
        probability(miss shot 1, make shot 2, make shot 3) +
        probability(make shot 1, make shot 2, make shot 3)
