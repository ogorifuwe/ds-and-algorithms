Chat Server: Explain how you would design a chat server. In parti-
cular, provide details about the various backend components, classes,
methods. What would be the hardest problem to solve?

Hint:

    *   As always scope the problem. Are "friendships" mutual?
        Do status messages exist? Do you support group chat?

    *   This is a good problem to think about the major system
        component or technologies that would be useful.

    *   How woll you know if a user is offline?
