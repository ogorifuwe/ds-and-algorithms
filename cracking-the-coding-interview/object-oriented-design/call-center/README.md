Call Center: Imagine you have a call center with three levels of
employees; respondent, manager, and director. An incoming tele-
phone call must be forst allocated to a respondent who is free.
If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate
the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to
handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design
the classes and data structure for this problem. Implement a method
dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the first available employee.

Hints:

    *   Before coding, make a list of the objects you need and walk
        through the common algorithms. Picture the code. Do you have
        everything you need?
