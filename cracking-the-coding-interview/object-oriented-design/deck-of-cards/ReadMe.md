Deck of Cards: Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards.
Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

Hints:

    *   Note that a "card deck" is very broad. You might want to think
        about a reasonable scope to the problem.

    *   How, if at all, will you handle aces?

    SOLUTION

    First, we need to recognize that a "generic" deck of cards can mean
    many things. Generic could mean a standard deck of cards that can
    play a poker-like game, or it could even stretch to Uno or Baseball
    cards. It is important to ask your interviewer what they mean by
    generic.

    Let's assume that your interviewer clarifies that the deck is a
    standard 52-card set, like you might see used in a blackjack or
    poker game.
