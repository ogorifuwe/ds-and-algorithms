Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such
that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal
to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to
be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x
can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear
between the left and right partitions.

EXAMPLE

Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1[partition = 5]

Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

    Hints:
    
    *   There are many solutions to this problem, most of which are equally
        optimal in runtime. Some have shorter, cleaner code than others.
        Can you brainstorn different solutions?
        
    *   Consider that the elements don't have to stay in the same relative
        order. We only need to ensure that elements that are less than the
        pivot must be before elements greater than the pivot. Does that help
        you come up with more solutons?
