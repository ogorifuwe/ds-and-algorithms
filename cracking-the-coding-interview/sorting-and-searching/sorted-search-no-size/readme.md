Sorted Search, No Size: You are given an array-like data structure Listy
which lacks a size method. It does, however have an elementAt(i) method
that returns the elment at index i in O(1) time. If i is beyond the bounds
of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure
only supports positive integers.) Given a Listy which contains sorted,
positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x
occurs multiple times, you may return any index.

Hints:

    Think about how binary search works. What will be the issue with
    just implementing binary search?

    Binary search requires comparing an element to the midpoint.
    Getting the midpoint requires knowing the length. We don't know
    the length. Can we find it?

    We can find the length by using an exponential backoff. First
    check index 2, then 4, then 8, then 16, and so on. What will
    be the runtime of this algorithm?
