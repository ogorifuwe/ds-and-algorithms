Search in Rotated Array: Given a sorted array of n integers that has
been rotated an unknown number of times, write code to find the element
in the array. You may assume that the array was originally sorted in
increasing order.

EXAMPLE

Input: Find 5 in {15, 16, 19, 20, 25, 1, 3, 4, 5,   7, 10, 14}
Output: 8 (the index of 5 in the array)

Hints:

    Can you modify binary search for this purpose?
    
    What is the runtime of your algorithm? What will happen if the 
    array has duplicates?
