Pairwise Swap: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with
as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and
bit 3 are swapped, and so on).

Hints:
    
    *   Swapping each pair means moving the even bits to the left and the odd
        bits to the right. Can you break this problem into parts?

    *   Can you create a number that represents just the even bits? Then can
        you shift the even bits over by one?

    *   The value 1010 in binary is 10 in decimal or 0xA in hex. What will a
        sequence of 101010... be in hex? That is, how do you represent an
        alternating sequence of 1s and 0s with 1s in the odd places? How do
        you do this for the reverse (1s in the even spot)?

    *   Try masks 0xaaaaaaaa and 0x55555555 to select the even and odd bits.
        Then try shifting the even and odd bits around to create the right
        number.
