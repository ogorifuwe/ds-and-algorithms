Conversion: Write a function to determine the number of bits you would
need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.

EXAMPLE

Input:  29 (or: 11101), to 15 (or: 01111)

Output: 2

Hints:
    *   How would you figure out how many bits are different between
        two numbers?

    *   Think about what an XOR indicates. If you do a XOR b, where
        does the result have 1s? Where does it have 0s?
