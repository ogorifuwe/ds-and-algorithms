Successor: Write an algorithm to find the "next" node (i.e., in-order
successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that
each node has a link to is parent.

    Hints:

    *   Think about how an in-order traversal works and try to "reverse
         engineer" it.

    *   Here's one step of the logic: The successor of a specific node
        is the leftmost node of the right subtree. What if there is no
         right subtree, though?
