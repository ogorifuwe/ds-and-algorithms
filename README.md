This repo is mostly a reflection of my journey with 
data structures and algorithms especially in preparation
for technical interviews, but most importantly gaining a
thorough understanding of their underlying concepts.

Please note that, solutions are not originally mine.

Study Materials include but are not limited to;
* Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell
* Java Structures by Duane A. Bailey
