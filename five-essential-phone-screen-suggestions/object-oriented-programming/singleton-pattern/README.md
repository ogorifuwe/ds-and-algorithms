Singleton Pattern
------------------

  Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides
  a global point of access to that instance. It can be useful in cases where
  you have a "global" object with exactly one instance.
  
  Please see Restaurant.java illustrative implementation.  

  NB: It should be noted that many people dislike the Singleton design
  pattern, even calling it "anti-pattern". One reason for this is that
  it can interfere with unit testing.
