Factory Method
--------------

  The factory method offers an interface for creating an instance of a
  class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate. You
  might want to implement this with the creator class being abstract and
  not providing an implementation for the Factory method. In this case,
  the Factory method would take a parameter representing which class to
  instantiate.

  See CardGame.java for example illustration.
