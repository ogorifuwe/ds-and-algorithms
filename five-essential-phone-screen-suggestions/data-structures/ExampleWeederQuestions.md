1. What are some really common data structures, e.g, in java.util?

    Maps, Trees, Graphs, Lists (ArrayList, LinkedLists), Stack, Queues, Arrays
     
2. When would you use a linked list vs a vector?
    
    When the capacity of the list is not know ahead of time, it is advisable to
    use a linkedlist because the list can easily be extended by added elements
    to the tail node of the list. Unlike an ArrayList where a new array double
    the size of the current array will be created and the element will be trans-
    ferred to the new array be the new element will be added and then the old
    array will be available for garbage collection.
    
    Computational expensive.

    Or an application where we would have to insert/delete data in the 

3. Can you implement a Map with a tree? What about with a list?

    Yes

4. How do you print out the nodes of a tree in level-order (i.e. first level,
   then 2nd level, then 3rd level etc.)

5. What's the worst-case insertion performance of a hashtable? Of a binary tree?

6. What are some options for implementing a priority queue?
