File System: Explain the data structures and algorithm that you would
use to design an in-memory file system. Illustrate with an example in
code where possible.

Hints:

    *   This is not as complicated as it sounds. Start by making a list
        of the key objects in the system, then think about how they in-
        teract.
    
    *   What is the relationship between files and directories?
